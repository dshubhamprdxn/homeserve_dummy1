  How does this plan differ from a manufacturer's warranty?
  :::
  ::: faq-content
  A manufacturer’s warranty typically only covers defects in materials and workmanship, and lasts for a limited time only. The Electronics Protection plan from HomeServe also covers accidental damage from handling (for example, it covers cracked screens for mobile phones, laptops, tablets), normal wear and tear, and power surges.

  What is the cancellation policy?
  :::
  ::: faq-content
  You may cancel within 30 days of your start date for a full refund; cancellations after the first 30 days will result in a pro rata refund less any claims paid (where applicable). If you find you have similar protection, you can cancel and receive a refund of your service agreement fee, less any claims paid (where applicable).
