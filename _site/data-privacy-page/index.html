<p><strong>Personal Data Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>We share any of the personal data we receive (listed above) for Our business and commercial purposes and as more specifically described below, including to comply with legal obligations and for auditing, security and anti-fraud purposes.</p>
<p><em>Service providers.</em> We share any of the personal data described above with service providers (including home service contractors, mailing and fulfillment vendors, service-related technology providers, marketing agencies and survey administrators) that provide services to You and Us, including to help Us conduct satisfaction surveys, send you offers of Our products and services, provide Our products and services, maintain Our databases and Websites, administer emails, and analyze Website usage activity. For example, We provide Your personal identifiers and job request information to home service contractors so they can provide their services to You. We may provide Your personal identifiers to print and communications vendors so that they can send You communications on Our behalf. We may also provide personal data, including personal identifiers, commercial information, and device and IP address information to Our service providers for fraud detection purposes. We require that service providers use personal data only for the purposes specified in Our agreements.</p>
<p><em>Other third parties providing services to us.</em> We also share personal data (including Your personal identifiers and financial information) with third parties to help Us provide products and services to You such as fulfilling and delivering orders, processing payments, social media functions, and administering sweepstakes or contests. We may share your personal identifiers and commercial information (the products and services You have purchased from Us) with Partners including Your utility so that We can manage Your account and provide You with Our products and services. We will provide Your personal identifiers and financial information to a payment processing vendor to complete a transaction You have requested. In these situations, You are using and directing Us to intentionally disclose personal information (including personal identifiers and financial information) so Our products and services and Your requests can be provided to You.</p>
<p><em>Affiliates.</em> We may also share any of Your personal data within Our group of companies that operate in or outside the United States (including in the EU) for the purposes described above. By providing Your personal data to Us, You fully understand and clearly consent to such use and transfers as set out in this Policy.</p>
<p><em>Legal and similar disclosures.</em> We may disclose personal information about You with law enforcement, the courts, Our advisors, attorneys, and others who participate in the legal process, if necessary to do so by law or based on Our good faith belief that it is necessary to enforce our rights or apply Our Terms of Use, conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect You, Us, the users of Our Websites, or others.</p>
<p><em>Sales, Mergers, and Acquisitions.</em> In the event of a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets (whether by private sale, through operation of law, as part of a divestiture plan, or otherwise), We will provide personal data and transaction history associated with each relevant business unit to the persons and/or entities assuming control of such business unit or as otherwise necessary to complete the transaction as permitted by law or contract, and they will be able to handle the personal information as stated in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting the personal data You share with Us. In order to prevent unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Your personal data, We have put in place commercially suitable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to secure Your personal data in both electronic and paper form. We control access to Our computer information systems containing Your personal data by User ID and password. We control access to Our paper records containing Information by keeping such information in secure areas with restricted access. We use up-to-date versions of security software, including malware, patches and antivirus software, firewalls, and encryption methods.</p>
<p>Transmission of information on the internet is not completely secure and therefore We cannot guarantee the security of the Information sent to Us electronically on Our Websites, or otherwise; transmission of such Information is therefore entirely at Your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, And Other Similar Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Like most websites, We and other companies use browser “cookies,” log files, beacons, pixels, and similar technology on the Websites and in our emails. Cookies and similar technology may collect Your personal identifiers (such as IP address, device and browser identifiers and characteristics, and other identifiers), information about Your device (such as operating system, browser characteristics, and language preferences), and Your usage activity on the Websites (such as Your interaction with Our Websites, the link You used to reach them, and the content and advertising displayed on them and Our content and advertising on other websites and online services).</p>
<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When You visit a website, that site’s computer asks Your computer for permission to store this file in a part of Your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to Your browser if Your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect Your privacy) Your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to You, not the cookies sent to You by other sites. You can manage or disable Your cookies by using tools of Your browser. If You choose to disable cookies, the cookies will not be used. However, if You do choose to remove cookies or reject cookies it may affect certain features or services of Our Website.</p>
<p>As You browse Our Websites, they use cookies to differentiate You from other Users in order to prevent You from seeing offers inapplicable to You or requiring You to log in more than is necessary for security. Cookies, in conjunction with Our web server’s log files, allow Us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting Our Website and determine which parts of the Website are most popular. This helps Us gather feedback in order to constantly improve Our Website and better serve Our customers.</p>
<p><strong>Online Advertising and Usage Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We use third-party advertising services to serve ads when You visit some of Our Websites and other websites and online services, third-party email services to send informational and marketing emails, and third-party analytics services to help Us understand and improve the usage of the Websites and our email. These services will collect Your personal identifiers (such as IP address, device id, and cookie information), device characteristics (such as browser version), and website browsing activity from You when you visit the Websites by placing cookies and using other similar technology. They use that information to provide advertisements to You on Our Websites and other non-affiliated websites and/or to provide analytical information for Our Websites. These third-party companies also may collect and combine information about Your online activities over time, on other devices, and on other websites or online services, if those websites and online services also use the same partners.</p>
<p>We currently use Google Analytics to collect and process certain usage data on Our Websites. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.

<p>When You make a request, we may require that You provide information and follow procedures so that we can verify the request and your jurisdiction before responding to it. The verification steps we take may differ depending on the request You make. We will match the information that You provide in your request to information we already have on file to verify your identity. If we are able to verify your request, we will process it. If we cannot verify your request, we may ask You for additional information to help us verify your request.<br>

California law permits California consumers to use an authorized agent to make privacy rights requests.

An authorized agent must follow the process described below to make a request, and We will additionally require the authorized agent to verify his/her own identity and We will confirm the agent’s authority with the California consumer about whom the request was made.</p>
