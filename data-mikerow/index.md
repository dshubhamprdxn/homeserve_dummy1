## HomeServe, the leader in home repair solutions, has teamed up with Mike Rowe, Americaâ€™s leading advocate for vocational training. We think it's a perfect fit.

You never know when a plumbing, electrical, heating or cooling breakdown might happen. HomeServe offers affordable repair plans that can help protect you from expensive repairs, from normal wear and tear, that are typically not covered by your basic homeowners insurance, local utility company or city/town.

Our coverage is like "roadside assistance" for your home. If you should ever suffer a covered home repair emergency, just call our 24-hour repair hotline and our customer service representatives will make sure your call is their priority.
